This is a very basic [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) plugin that prints names of files. It's useful as a debugging tool to see which files are moving through the pipe or as a status printout.

## Installation

```sh
npm install gulp-print
```

## Usage Example

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var print = require('gulp-print');
```

Using default formatter:

```js
gulp.task('print', function() {
  gulp.src('test/*.js')
    .pipe(print())
});
```

Or using custom formatter:

```js
gulp.task('print', function() {
  gulp.src('test/*.js')
    .pipe(print(function(filepath) {
      return "built: " + filepath;
    }))
});
```

If you want to turn colors off:

```js
gulp.task('print', function() {
  gulp.src('test/*.js')
    .pipe(print({colors: false}));
});
```

## API

### print(format or {format, colors})

* `format` is a callback format function that passes in filepath to be printed. Callback should return a string which will be printed.
* `colors` is a boolean which defaults to `true`.

## Testing

```sh
npm test
```
